### A calculator that runs in the browser and:
- Can handle **multiple operators** at a time
- Respects **order of operations**
- Can be installed as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**

---

This app was a first practice project for learning react and was bootstrapped using [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

### Design Notes:
- **Class-based components** were used because:
    - **Legacy Code**: Many legacy codebases still use them, so it's useful to be familiar with them.
    - **Maintenance**: At some point, I will likely need to either extend those legacy codebases using class-based components, or convert their components to functional components.
    - **Familiarity**: I was already familiar with the design patterns around class-based components because of past experience, so it made it easier to get started.
- **Functional components** with hooks will likely be used in future projects.
